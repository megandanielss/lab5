## Glacier and Snow Cover Mapping and Monitoring

1)	In "Mapping Glacier Snow Cover and Associated Properties Using Unmanned Aerial Vehicle and Ground-Based Measurements," Mingo et al. (2020) came up with a method to map glacier snow cover and associated properties using UAVs. They used computer vision techniques such as image segmentation and object detection, to classify snow cover. They measured snow depth using ground-based sensors and estimated snow density using photogrammetry. Thet reported high accuracy in mapping snow cover compared to traditional manual methods.

2)	In "Automated Snow Cover Detection and Monitoring Using Sentinel-2 Data and Convolutional Neural Networks," by Kulkarni et al. (2020), the authors used Sentinel-2 satellite imagery and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to automate snow cover detection and monitoring. The CNNs were trained to identify snow cover based on spectral characteristics like reflectance and vegetation indices. They discovered using CNNs improved the accuracy of snow cover detection compared to traditional methods.

3)	Liu et al. (2020), "A Deep Learning-Based Approach to Snow Cover Monitoring Using Multi-Satellite Data” the authors show deep learning-based approaches to snow cover monitoring using multiple satellite data. They used CNN to combine data from multiple satellites, including Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and MODIS, to monitor snow cover over a large area.
